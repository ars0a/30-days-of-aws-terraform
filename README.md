This repository documents my complete #30DaysOfAWSTerraform journey — a structured, hands-on challenge focused on mastering Terraform in the AWS ecosystem.

I started this challenge with one simple rule: show up every single day and build something. No shortcuts. No passive learning. Just real infrastructure, written as code.

For a while, I was actively writing about AWS concepts. Then I realized something important. Reading and writing about cloud is useful, but building it daily changes how you think. That shift is what this challenge is about.

This repo is not a tutorial dump. It is a living record of progress, mistakes, experiments, and improvements across 30 focused days.

## 📖 What This Series Is About

The goal is simple but serious:
Develop strong, practical Terraform skills by building infrastructure on AWS from scratch, step by step.

Instead of randomly jumping between topics, I’m following a structured path. Each day builds on the previous one. By the end of the 30 days, the idea is not just to “know Terraform,” but to be comfortable designing, provisioning, modifying, and destroying real infrastructure safely and confidently.

**This journey includes:**

- Writing Terraform configurations from scratch

- Understanding state management deeply

- Working with modules

- Handling variables and outputs properly

- Deploying real AWS services

- Debugging real errors

- Learning cost awareness

- Practicing infrastructure cleanup discipline

This is hands-on cloud engineering, not theory.

# 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into 30 separate folders, one for each day of the challenge.

```bash
Day-01/
Day-02/
Day-03/
...
Day-30/
```

Each folder represents a complete learning cycle for that day. Inside, you’ll find:

Terraform configuration files used for that specific topic
Clear explanations of what was built and why
Commands executed during the process
Problems faced and how they were resolved
Screenshots (where relevant)
A link to the related blog or video for deeper explanation

Every folder is self-contained so that you can navigate day-by-day without confusion.

## 🧠 Why I Started This Challenge

Consistency beats intensity.

It’s easy to get excited about DevOps tools for a week. It’s harder to stay disciplined for 30 straight days. That discipline is exactly what I wanted to build.

This challenge helps me:

Develop a strong infrastructure mindset
Understand Terraform beyond syntax
Think in terms of state and lifecycle
Become comfortable breaking and fixing things
Build the habit of documenting real work

There’s another layer to this as well. Along the way, I’m sharing one small personal insight each day. It keeps the journey human. Cloud engineering is technical, but the growth behind it is personal.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

This series primarily focuses on:

Terraform
AWS (EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, Lambda, RDS, Elastic Beanstalk and more as the challenge progresses)
Git & GitHub for version control
Linux-based environment for execution

All infrastructure is provisioned using Infrastructure as Code principles.

---

## 🎯 What You’ll Gain From This Repo

If you explore this repository carefully, you will:

See how Terraform projects evolve gradually
Understand real command usage and execution flow
Learn how mistakes are identified and corrected
See practical folder structuring for Terraform projects
Observe how infrastructure is managed and destroyed responsibly

This is not polished demo-only code. It reflects actual learning progression.

## 🤝 How You Can Use This Repository

You can browse each day’s folder and follow along at your own pace.
You can fork it and recreate the projects in your own AWS account.
You can compare your structure with mine.
You can even start your own 30-day infrastructure challenge.

If you are learning Terraform, this repository can serve as both a roadmap and a reality check.

## 📌 Final Note

This is a growth log. Some days are simple. Some days are messy. All days are honest.

By the end of these 30 days, the objective isn’t just to complete a challenge. It’s to think like someone who understands infrastructure deeply and builds it responsibly.

Let’s build.
